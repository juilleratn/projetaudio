			<p> "It's akin to the ancient art of Bonsa√Ø" explain Bonn O'Brien between sips of house blend at a Brooklyn coffe shop. "It takes an eye for details. It's reverence, respect, and a steady hand all rolled into one. It's the only way to take care of a proper board. We take the same approach to our music."</p>

			<p> Three years ago, the O'Brien-lead The Dapper Beards burst into the country's collective consciousness like a Salvador Dali's stache thanks to their now-iconic appearence of the trendy periodical "Garden and Gun". "The Beards Are Here, And They Will Save Folk Music" read the headline. The striking image of the four bandmates in repose.</p>

			<p> Over the next few years, Bostic and other University of California employees worked to replace the missing components and turn BSD into a complete, freely redistributable operating system. Although delayed by a legal challenge from Unix Systems Laboratories-the AT&T spin-off that retained ownership of the Unix brand name-the effort would finally bear fruit in the early 1990s. Even before then, however, many of the Berkeley utilities would make their way into Stallman's GNU Project.</p>

			<p> The German sociologist Max Weber once proposed that all great religions are built upon the "routinization" or "institutionalization" of charisma. Every successful religion, Weber argued, converts the charisma or message of the original religious leader into a social, political, and ethical apparatus more easily translatable across cultures and time.</p>

			<p> Over time, however, Lippman says her son learned to adjust. By age seven, she says, her son had become fond of standing at the front window of subway trains, mapping out and memorizing the labyrinthian system of railroad tracks underneath the city. It was a hobby that relied on an ability to accommodate the loud noises that accompanied each train ride. "Only the initial noise seemed to bother him," says Lippman. "It was as if he got shocked by the sound but his nerves learned how to make the adjustment."</p>

			<p> With no dorm and no desire to return to New York, Stallman followed a path blazed by Greenblatt, Gosper, Sussman, and the many other hackers before him. Enrolling at MIT as a grad student, Stallman rented an apartment in nearby Cambridge but soon viewed the AI Lab itself as his de facto home.</p>

			<p> Thirty years after the fact, Lippman punctuates the memory with a laugh. "To tell you the truth, I don't think I ever figured out how to solve that puzzle," she says. "All I remember is being amazed he knew the answer."</p>
